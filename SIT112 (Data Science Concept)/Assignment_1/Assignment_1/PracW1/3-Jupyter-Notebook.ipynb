It is based on the IPython shell, but provides a cell-based web page environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way. In this note we will demonstrate how to load (read) a notebook, execute, and create one. \n",

Since many of its components are language-agnostic and can be used with other languages, after this release they have been moved to Jupyter Notebook for better development. Jupyter Notebooks can be used along with languages such as ``Julia``, `'Python'`, ``R``, ``Ruby``, `'Matlab'`, `'Octave'`, and many other. \n",
